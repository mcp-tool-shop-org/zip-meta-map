## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline) (2026-02-27)

### Default safety posture

- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: analysis-only CLI — reads files, generates metadata, no destructive actions
- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` File operations constrained to known directories (reads input, writes to user-specified output) (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[cli]` Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 user error · 2 runtime error · 3 partial success (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[cli]` No raw stack traces without `--debug` (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop application
- [ ] `[vscode]` SKIP: not a VS Code extension

## C. Operator Docs

- [x] `[all]` README is current: what it does, install, usage, supported platforms + runtime versions (2026-02-27)

- [x] `[all]` LICENSE file present and repo states support status (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[cli]` `--help` output accurate for all commands and flags (build, explain, diff, validate) (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: CLI tool — no logging levels needed
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## Gate Rules

**Hard gate (A–D):** Must pass before any version is tagged or published.
If a section doesn't apply, mark `SKIP:` with justification — don't leave it unchecked.

**Soft gate (E):** Should be done. Product ships without it, but isn't "whole."
